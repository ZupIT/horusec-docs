## What is it? 

Manager is Horusec's  graphical interface, which is possible to: 

* Create an account and authenticate;
* View and analyze the vulnerabilities found by the CLI;
* Manage platform's accesses. 

You will see below more details on how to make each one of these activities.

## Creating an account 

Manager creates an account inside Horusec. After your user is created, you just need to confirm the account on your email.

## Authentication

Horusec offers a simple authentication managed by its own system.

## Analytics dashboard

When an analysis is sent to Horusec to store, you have access to a detailed dashboard with the organization or repository's view related to that analysis. 

This analytical view help managers to train developers about safe development or even to identify if the repository is with vulnerabilities to be corrected according to its severity. 

See more about these data in the table below:
