Now, it is necessary to update the Horusec validations. When you receive an analysis on the server, you have to check if the tools and languages sent for the server are valid.

See the path

`development-kit/pkg/usecases/analysis/analysis.go`

On the the **`analysis.go`** file look for:

* The **`sliceTools`** and then update it. See the example:

```text
func (au *UseCases) sliceTools() []interface{} {
	return []interface{}{
		...
		tools.GoSec
	}
}
```

* The **`sliceLanguages`** function and update it. See an example: 

```text
func (au *UseCases) sliceLanguages() []interface{} {
	return []interface{}{
		...
		languages.Go
	}
}
```
