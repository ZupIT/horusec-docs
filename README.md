## **About**
Horusec is an open source tool that performs a static code analysis to identify security flaws during the development process. Currently, the languages for analysis are C#, Java, Kotlin, Python, Ruby, Golang, Terraform, Javascript, Typescript, Kubernetes, PHP, C, HTML, JSON, Dart, Elixir, Shell, Nginx. 
The tool has options to search for key leaks and security flaws in all your project's files, as well as in Git history. Horusec can be used by the developer through the CLI and by the DevSecOps team on CI /CD mats.
